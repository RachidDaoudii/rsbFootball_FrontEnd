               <strong>
               Reinvention often comes in spurts, after a long period of silence.
               Just as modern architecture recently enjoyed a comeback, brand
               architecture, a field with well-established principles for
               decades, is back in the limelight.
               </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
               Simply understood, brand{" "}
               <a href="/post/3-meaningful-ways-to-practice-self-care-as-an-introvert">
               architecture
               </a>{" "}
               is the art and science of structuring the portfolio to meet your
               strategic goals, defining the brand number, scope, and relationships
               needed to compete. Just as Modern Architecture prioritized function,
               a Brand Architecture is only as good as it is well-suited for the
               purpose it strives to achieve. Given the disruption observed today
               across industries and segments, it’s no wonder that companies are
               considering structural rather than topical solutions to the
               challenges they face.
            </p>
            <p>
               Yet the context in which brand architecture decisions are being made
               has changed. Gone are the days of “competitive strategy”, with the
               military-inspired view of competition as a zero-sum game, where
               market share needs to be stolen from competitors, often in a
               street-by-street battle to win over each individual segment. The
               type of brand architecture required to win in this game demanded a
               dogged focus on each segment, and a sniper-like collection of
               individual brands sharply focused on each one. While there was
               always a place for a variety of architectures — see Joachimsthaler’s
               brand relationship spectrum — houses of brands were favored, as it
               enabled segment-by-segment competition and risk protection. P&amp;G
               was the king of houses of brands, slicing and dicing the market not
               just by products and demographics, but also by psychographics, price
               range, buying patterns or attitudes. In B2B, houses of brands were
               omnipresent, with a product-driven logic that led to branding new
               features meant to provide short-term competitive advantage.
            </p>
            <p>
               In today’s day and age, companies like Google or Amazon do not
               pursue growth through incremental market share gains; rather, they
               focus on understanding their customers’ needs and creating entirely
               new markets to answer them. Creating a house of brands for these
               markets would be folly — not only would each brand need to be
               created from scratch, increasing the already significant investment,
               but the new category itself often needs to be explained to
               consumers, compounding the cost.
            </p>
            <p>
               Instead, investing in a strong master brand-led architecture and
               putting multiple if not all brands under the leadership of a strong
               brand, presents numerous advantages. First, mergers and
               acquisitions, or partnerships, are making it necessary to bring
               multiple market participants to “the same page” — and this common
               ground often involves a master brand recognized by all. Second, the
               risk profile of a “branded house” architecture has changed: the
               master brand can create an aura of innovation and risk-taking,
               supporting the launch of new products. Third, investments can be
               streamlined, as a strong master brand can be leveraged across
               markets and product launches. Finally, a track record of success in
               creating new categories can create goodwill, creating a virtual
               circle of success. To achieve this, brand architecture does not need
               to be a pure “branded house” — in many cases, a strong master brand
               creates substantial leverage and a much cleaner portfolio, even as a
               few particularly strong brands can continue existing as sub-brands.
               An example of this is Salesforce, that leverages its master brand
               consistently — yet allows more independence to a few specific
               sub-brands, such as Pardot.
            </p>

               <strong>
               There are 3 key imperatives to build this type of brand
               architecture — to be clear, meaningful and stretchable.
               </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
               <strong>Clear</strong>: Just as modern architecture thrives on clear
               and clean lines, so does brand architecture. In the age of
               micro-segmentation, micro-targeting, information overload and
               digital fragmentation, you need a clear and loud voice in order to
               stand out. In the context of short attention spans where specific
               moments and needstates need to be targeted in addition to
               consumer/customer profiles, multiple brands often lead to confusion.
               The technology space understood this early, where clear and simple
               architectures that bring together simple design, as Apple, with
               complex technology, as SAP — always under the discipline of a
               rigorously simple way to organize.
            </p>
            <p>
               In addition, one of the key reasons for the regained popularity of
               clean, streamlined architectures, often organized around a single
               master brand, has been the emergence of platforms, or 2-way
               marketplaces structured around mutual value creation. By definition,
               bringing various stakeholder groups to one <strong>platform</strong>{" "}
               requires building a <strong>single brand</strong>, in order to
               enable network effects so critical for building scale. As Uber
               expands into different marketplaces and “uberizes” different
               industries, leveraging the power of its master brand is likely to
               lead to faster expansion than building a targeted brand for each
               industry from scratch.
            </p>
            <p>
               <strong>Meaningful</strong>: Just as modern architecture prioritizes
               function over embellishments, a solid brand architecture is founded
               on brands and values meaningful to consumers (or customers), rather
               than product feature distinctions. Brand architecture needs to be
               re-organized around brands that have a “reason for being” compelling
               enough to elicit passion, and introducing a clear distinction
               between brands that merit air time with consumers vs. “clutter”. The
               “decluttering” trend is gaining traction in brand architecture —
               just as in the popular consumer “decluttering” technique, only
               brands that “bring joy” to consumers get the spotlight. TED, for
               example, leverages the powerful TED master brand, positioned around
               “ideas worth spreading”, in a set of sub-brands that target
               meaningful occasions and contexts for intellectual exploration (TED
               Talks, TEDx, TED-Ed, TED Prize, TED Fellows, TED Institute, TED
               Radio Hour).
            </p>
            <p>
               <strong>Stretchable</strong>: Modern architecture is dynamic — it
               finds its force in the midst of usage; movement is often embedded
               into its very bones. In today’s fast-changing world, brand
               architecture is a moving target — clients increasingly ask to design
               architectures that fit their growth ambitions, thinking through
               future growth scenarios and architecting space for the future
               product pipeline. In particular in industries undergoing disruption,
               where next generation products aim to upset the status quo, their
               addition to any brand architecture may require a fundamental
               rethink.
            </p>
            <p>
               Much as strategy has become “real time” as the window for strategic
               planning has shortened, brand architecture is also becoming more
               “real time”, requiring more frequent reassessment, adaptations and
               flexibility as markets change. Witness the frequency with which Uber
               readjusts its portfolio. WeWork, the popular co-working space, also
               exploits the strength of the master brand to stretch into near-in
               categories such as hospitality with WeLive or the ventures space
               with WeWork Labs.
            </p>
            <p>
               Traditionally, companies considered a house of brands architecture
               as a risk management tool — a way not to put all your eggs in one
               basket. It turns out, in the age of platforms and digital
               disruption, a masterbrand-led architecture can help you build a
               bigger basket, to hold more eggs.
